Lab V (Functions):
1.	Write a function sum that takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum. Call this function from the main function and print the result.
2.	Write a program that demonstrates nesting of functions, where each function performs a specific arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers.
3.	Write a recursive function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given integer. Use this function to find the factorial of 5.
4.	Write a function findMax that takes an array of integers and its size as arguments and returns the maximum element in the array.
5.	Write a function stringLength that takes a string as an argument and returns its length.
6.	Write a program that demonstrates passing arguments by address. Define a function swap that takes two integer pointers as arguments and swaps the values they point to. Print the swapped values from the main function.
